This is a bare bones .vimrc template and supporting neovim plugin config for Rust.

What it has is extreme basic plugins to get you started with rust.

What it does not have are the customizations needed for personalization.

You can use the provided nvim/coc-settings.json to store any config for coc.nvim (the coc-rust-analyzer extension for coc.nvim takes care of installing and setting the rust-analyzer language server protocol. So I just left it empty)
